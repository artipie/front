To publish your PHP Composer package create package description JSON file my-package.json with the following content:
<pre>
{
  "name": "my-org/my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dist": {
    "url": "https://www.my-org.com/files/my-package.1.0.0.zip",
    "type": "zip"
  }
}
</pre>
And add it to repository using PUT request:
<pre>
$ curl -X PUT -T 'my-package.json' "http://localhost:8080/my-php"
</pre>
To use this library in your project add requirement and repository to composer.json:
<pre>
{
    "repositories": [
         {"type": "composer", "url": "http://localhost:8080/my-php"}
    ],
    "require": {
        "my-org/my-package": "1.0.0"
    }
}
</pre>
